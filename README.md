# Example Repository for Automated Acceptance Tests

This is the example repository for the medium blogpost series 'Patterns for scalable automated acceptance tests'.

The setup is simple webdriver.io instance with a basic typescript setup. The goal is to keep it as simple as possible, so we start without gherkin/cucumber, screenshot comparison tests, etc.

To run it, just check it out, run `yarn` or `npm install` followed by `yarn test` / `npm run test`
